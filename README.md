# cpp_chain_reaction
Chain Reaction multipayer game to demostrate the usage and applications of Data Structures using C++.

The game uses the some of the concepts of the basic data structures such as:
<ul>
  <li>Linked List</li>
  <liTrees></li>
  <li>Graphs</li>
</ul>

Some of the libraries we used besides the common iostream and conio libraries:
<ol type="1">
  <li><details><summary>map</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>To map the game nodes to integers for direct access instead of using search function.</li>
      </ul>
  </details></li>
  
  <li><details><summary>stdlib</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Most importantly to generate random integers to mark the moves of the self playing bot.</li>
        <li>Make use of the system function to associate players with a color.</li>
      </ul>
  </details></li>
</ol>
