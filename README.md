# cpp_chain_reaction
Chain Reaction multipayer game to demostrate the usage and applications of Data Structures using C++.

The game uses the some of the concepts of the basic data structures such as:
> Linked List
> Trees
> Graphs

Some of the libraries we used besides the common iostream and conio libraries:

> map -> To map the game nodes to integers for direct access instead of using search function.

> stdlib -> Most importantly to generate random integers to mark the moves of the self playing bot.<br/>
         -> Make use of the system function to associate players with a color.
